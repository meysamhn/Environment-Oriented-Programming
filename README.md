Environment-Oriented Programming (EOP)
The Revolution Your Code Has Been Waiting For


🌍 # EOP Manifesto: Code That Breathes With Its Environment  

We stand at the brink of a programming revolution. For decades, we've forced reality into the rigid cages of objects and classes - but the world doesn't work that way.  

## 🚫 The Broken Promise of OOP:

✨ Behold Environment-Oriented Programming:

World City:
  - Rules: 
    • Happiness spreads like light (radius: 100m)
    • Roles emerge from location
  - Entities:
    • @Person enters ➔ becomes Citizen
    • @Tree added ➔ AirQuality += 0.5%

run World with Physics:SocialGravity

🔥 Why This Changes Everything:
Context is King
Your code finally understands that a Chair in a burning building becomes an EscapeTool

Environmental DNA
Environments mutate their own rules:
Reality Ripple Effect
Changes propagate through environmental networks:
HospitalPowerOutage ➔ TrafficLightFailure ➔ StreetChaos
